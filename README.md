# üõ°Ô∏è Security Operations Center (SOC) Internship Journey

## üîç Overview: WELCOME TO MY SOC INTERNSHIP JOURNEY REPOSITORY!
This repository documents my hands-on learning experience during my **SOC Internship**, where I explored how to monitor, detect, and analyze threats using **Wazuh**, **Sysmon**, and **APTSimulator**.

---

## üß© Topics Covered

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to SOC and Wazuh Installation
- Learned SOC fundamentals ‚Äî roles, workflow, and components.
- Installed **Wazuh Manager**, **Dashboard**, and **Agent**.
- Understood how Wazuh collects, analyzes, and visualizes endpoint logs.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Windows Server Integration with Wazuh (Event 7045)
- Installed and configured **Windows Server**.
- Deployed the **Wazuh Agent** on Windows and connected it to the Wazuh Manager.
- Monitored **Event ID 7045** (service creation) to detect new or suspicious services.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sysmon Configuration and Wazuh Integration
- Installed **Sysmon (System Monitor)** for detailed system telemetry.
- Applied a **custom Sysmon configuration** to log process creation, file changes, and DNS queries.
- Integrated Sysmon logs with Wazuh for enhanced visibility.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ APT Simulation Testing
- Installed **APTSimulator** to simulate advanced persistent threat behaviors.
- Ran attack simulations to test Wazuh‚Äôs detection capabilities.
- Successfully observed Sysmon and Wazuh alerts for simulated threats.
